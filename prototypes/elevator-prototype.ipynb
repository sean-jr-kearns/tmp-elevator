    "# Elevator Project\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to prototype elevator behaviour in a prototype \n",
    "style script and translate from python to cpp. This notebook behaves more like a playground w.r.t implementation to provide more insight into my thinking. \n",
    "For actual project deliverables consider the cpp solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "Below are a list of assumptions for the elevator implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An elevator has 3 main controllable interaction patterns:\n",
    "    - Buttons on each floor that the elevator has access to in a \n",
    "      building/structure\n",
    "        - UP/DOWN\n",
    "    - Buttons within the elevator \n",
    "        - Id buttons representing each floor (usually numbers)\n",
    "        - Security/Fire safety system override (requires key)\n",
    "    - PA for communication into/out of the elevator\n",
    "- The existence of more than one elevator in a building does not necessarily \n",
    "  change the behavior of an elevator (although some elevators may be defined \n",
    "  to have inaccessible floors)\n",
    "- To ensure that an elevator doesn't try to optimize mobility and miss floors \n",
    "  that have been keyed in the elevator will maintain a priority ordered \n",
    "  schedule based on first in first out, and also continue in a direction \n",
    "  that has regularly been prioritized until reaching the furthest requested \n",
    "  floor in a direction before changing directions. This process will repeat \n",
    "  indefinitely while in operation and under direct input command\n",
    "- An elevator will not move if it has not received an input command\n",
    "- An elevator will move towards the input command floors with FIFO in mind\n",
    "- An elevator has a fixed capacity and although some optimizations could be \n",
    "  made there is a risk of not following FIFO in general \n",
    "- If an elevator has been manually stopped for security/fire it cannot be \n",
    "  restarted until that external service has restarted it (e.g. regardless of \n",
    "  floor position the elevator should cease movement--note that it is ideal \n",
    "  if it can stop at a floor and will be assumed as true for the purposes \n",
    "  of this exercise)\n",
    "- An elevator on the top floor has no up button\n",
    "- An elevator on the bottom floor has no down button\n",
    "- The lowest floor (ground) is floor 0\n",
    "- The highest floor is defined on elevator construction\n",
    "- Floor travel time also includes floor settling time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "- Restricted floors (may require at least the following attributes to be \n",
    "  defined, and known security rules preventing piggy-backing)\n",
    "    - It is assumed if a restricted floors feature was added camera \n",
    "      footage would be available in the elevator to know if the elevator \n",
    "      is empty prior to granting access to a restricted floor (given badge/key)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "    self.isEmpty = <bool>\n",

    "    # List of unordered floors that must also have a card/key entry within \n",
    "    # the elevator to proceed\n",
    "    # Otherwise the input request is ignored\n",
    "    self.restrictedAccessFloors = [<int>,..]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- The historical/floors visited ids are meant for tracking visibility (in \n",
    "  the context of this project) and would likely require batching/id resetting \n",
    "  after a fixed duration to prevent the id's from getting out of control\n",
    "- It is possible for accuracy to use type double for FLOOR_TRAVEL_TIME in \n",
    "  the future\n",
    "- Safety and Security events can be inherited from parent (e.g. Building) \n",
    "  and thus will not be handled; starting with\n",
    "- Database for storing elevator activities might be useful in the event \n",
    "  that their is a power outage while the elevator is operational\n",
    "- Keeping track of movement state could be useful in the future\n",
    "- Not including methods to interact directly with elevator accessor like \n",
